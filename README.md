  # About
  Readme Generator generates a markdown file based on your answers to a series of questions. This simplifies the process of making a meaningful markdown that others can easily understand. The readme will include the name, installation, instructions, and guidelines to contributing to your project, as well as how to contact you in the event of any issues or questions.

  # Installation
  Download the files from the Github repository. Access the folder from your terminal, and run >npm install< as the application does require npm packages that are not included in the repository. After running this command, everything will be installed for you. Information on these can be found in the package.json file included in the application.

  # Usage
  Once you have the packages installed, run index.js and the questions will begin appearing in your terminal. Please answer these questions as meaningfully and descriptively as possible, as these answers is what will determine the content of the readme that will be generated. If you attempt to submit any prompt without an answer, you will be given an error and asked to resubmit. Once you have finished answering the prompts, a readme.md file will be created inside of the dist folder in the location where you saved and ran the repo from.
  You can see the application in use in this [demo video.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NZdbK-gPdKMo064WNsrNdT3alqX0YzM/view?usp=sharing)
